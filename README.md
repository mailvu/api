4.1. Process











1. Your client (Mobile phone or browser) uploads the video to our server. It passes a unique request Id that identifies that upload. This request Id could be any string (GUID).
2. Once the upload is complete the server responds with an OK message to the mobile phone client. On a desktop, you can supply a redirect URL in the request so we can redirect the user to that URL. This enables you to add a custom “Thank You” page.
3. mailVU then starts converting the video into other formats and creates a thumbnail image from the video.
4. After processing is complete, mailVU will call your callback server with an HTTP post and pass you details about the video. The details include a play back URL, URL for thumbnail image, video dimensions and length.
5. You can now store this information in your database and serve it up to the user.
